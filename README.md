I'm currently a full time student at FIU pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science.
I'm also trying to learn and absorb as much as I can outside of that because school doesn't teach you everything and I want to be a skilled computer engineer capable of learning and working on anything in the field.
I chose this path in the Summer of 2020 and had no prior experience, so I'm trying to learn as much as I can and gain as much experience as possible before I graduate in the Summer of 2022.
